# Pwc-PowerBi Job Simulation Dashboard

## Background 
As I deepened my journey into data analytics, I found myself naturally drawn to Power BI‚Äîits intuitive interface and many familiar functions from Microsoft Excel made it an ideal tool for transitioning into more advanced data visualization and reporting.
When I came across a job simulation opportunity, I eagerly took on the challenge. Motivated by the opportunity to extract actionable insights from raw data and respond to a real-world problem statement, I committed approximately three hours each day and successfully completed all three tasks within two days.
## Introduction 
Forage is an online platform that offers virtual job simulations, giving students and professionals from all backgrounds the opportunity to explore what it's like to work at some of the world‚Äôs leading companies.
I took part in PwC Switzerland‚Äôs Power BI Virtual Experience Program, designed to help participants build practical skills in data analysis and dashboard creation using Power BI.
The simulation is structured around three core tasks:
1.Task 1: Call Centre Trends ‚Äî Analyze customer and agent behaviors by creating a Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and patterns from the provided dataset.
2.Task 2: Customer Retention ‚Äî Use defined KPIs to build a dashboard focused on customer demographics and retention insights.
3.Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion ‚Äî Develop visualizations based on HR data, with an emphasis on gender-related metrics within the executive team
Here are tasks breakdown;

### Visualization 
## Insights into Call Centre Trends

Below information explains the visual above for call center performance reeview 

## 1. Call Answering Performance
Over the three-month period, a total of 4,880 calls were recorded. Out of these:
81.11% (3,960 calls) were successfully answered.
18.89% (920 calls) went unanswered.
This high answering rate indicates efficient call handling at the call centre.
## 2. Issue Resolution Rate
Among the answered calls:
72.94% (3,561 calls) were resolved successfully.
27.06% (1,319 calls) remained unresolved.
Although a majority of calls were resolved, there‚Äôs a significant percentage of unresolved issues that may affect customer satisfaction.
## 3. Customer Satisfaction
The average customer satisfaction score across all agents was 2.76 out of 5.
This is noticeably below the expected benchmark of 4.2, pointing to potential dissatisfaction with the service quality, tone, or resolution effectiveness.
All agents contributed significantly, but variations in response time and satisfaction scores suggest training and quality consistency can be improved.
## 5. Monthly Call Volume Trends
Call volumes were relatively stable each month, with around 1,900 calls received in January, February, and March.
The majority of calls each month were answered, reflecting consistent service delivery.
## 6. Overall Efficiency
The overall average speed of answer was 67.53 seconds, which is moderately acceptable.
There is a clear need to improve satisfaction levels and reduce unresolved cases.

# Customer Retention

## üë• Customer Demographics
Gender Split: Roughly equal distribution between male and female.
Senior Citizens: 25%
Customers with Partners: 36%
Dependent Customers: 17%
## üìÖ Customer Tenure
29% of customers have been subscribed for less than one year, suggesting that newer customers are more prone to churn.
Only 21% have been with the company for over six years, implying potential issues with long-term retention.

## üí≥ Account Details & Billing Preferences
Most Common Payment Method:
Electronic Check: 34%
Followed by Mailed Checks, Bank Transfers, and Credit Cards (22‚Äì23% each).
Paperless Billing Adoption: 40.8%
Average Monthly Charges: $64.76
Total Charges (All Time): ~$2,283.30
## Contract Types:
Month-to-Month is dominant, which can be a churn risk.
Two-year contracts are least common, suggesting fewer customers are locked into long-term agreements.

## Customer Risk Analysis 
![alt text](https://github.com/HenryUnaeze/Pwc-Project-/blob/main/Pwc%20Task%202.1%20(Risk).png)

Below are the insight of customer risk analysis
1. Customer retention in the telecom industry is vital because gaining new customers is significantly more difficult.
2. The retention team is essential for reconnecting with customers who have chosen to cancel their contracts.
3. Currently, this method is reactive‚Äîreaching out only after contracts end‚Äîbut a proactive strategy to identify customers at risk of leaving would yield better results.
## Diversity and Inclusion

Overview of the Diversity & Inclusion Metrics in the HRD Dashboard:
### Hiring
- Female employees are consistently outnumbered by male employees at every job level.
- The representation of women declines progressively from entry-level positions to senior roles.
### Promotions
- Fewer women receive promotions compared to men.
- Women spend more time on average at their current level before being promoted than men do.
- The share of female employees continues to drop as job levels rise.
### Turnover
- Women generally receive lower performance ratings than their male counterparts.
- Female employees exhibit a higher likelihood of leaving the organization than males.
### Executive Diversity
- Women are underrepresented in executive positions relative to men.
- A slight increase in the proportion of female executives was observed in FY21 compared to FY20.
### Performance Rating
- On average, women receive higher performance ratings than men.
- However, fewer women achieve an ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù rating compared to men.
### Age Group
- The percentage of female employees decreases with advancing age groups.
- There is a greater proportion of male employees aged 50 and above than females in the same age bracket.
## Potential Diversity & Inclusion Issues Highlighted by the HRD Dashboard
1. Significant gender disparities exist in hiring and promotion, with women notably underrepresented at higher organizational levels.

2. Gender differences in performance ratings and turnover suggest women face barriers that may hinder their career progression.

3. The scarcity of female executives points to a need for strengthening the leadership pipeline for women.

# Recommendations for Enhancing Diversity & Inclusion in the HRD Dashboard

1. Adopt strategies to attract and retain women, including focused recruitment, mentorship opportunities, and leadership training.

2. Address potential bias in performance evaluations by introducing unconscious bias training and creating gender-neutral appraisal systems.

3. Offer flexible working options to support women‚Äôs career growth and better work-life integration.

4. Establish clear promotion targets for women and create defined pathways to executive roles
