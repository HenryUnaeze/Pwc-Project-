# Pwc-PowerBi Job Simulation Dashboard

## Background 
As I deepened my journey into data analytics, I found myself naturally drawn to Power BI—its intuitive interface and many familiar functions from Microsoft Excel made it an ideal tool for transitioning into more advanced data visualization and reporting.
When I came across a job simulation opportunity, I eagerly took on the challenge. Motivated by the opportunity to extract actionable insights from raw data and respond to a real-world problem statement, I committed approximately three hours each day and successfully completed all three tasks within two days.
## Introduction 
Forage is an online platform that offers virtual job simulations, giving students and professionals from all backgrounds the opportunity to explore what it's like to work at some of the world’s leading companies.
I took part in PwC Switzerland’s Power BI Virtual Experience Program, designed to help participants build practical skills in data analysis and dashboard creation using Power BI.
