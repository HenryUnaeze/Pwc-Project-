# Pwc-PowerBi Job Simulation Dashboard

## Background 
As I deepened my journey into data analytics, I found myself naturally drawn to Power BIâ€”its intuitive interface and many familiar functions from Microsoft Excel made it an ideal tool for transitioning into more advanced data visualization and reporting.
When I came across a job simulation opportunity, I eagerly took on the challenge. Motivated by the opportunity to extract actionable insights from raw data and respond to a real-world problem statement, I committed approximately three hours each day and successfully completed all three tasks within two days.
## Introduction 
Forage is an online platform that offers virtual job simulations, giving students and professionals from all backgrounds the opportunity to explore what it's like to work at some of the worldâ€™s leading companies.
I took part in PwC Switzerlandâ€™s Power BI Virtual Experience Program, designed to help participants build practical skills in data analysis and dashboard creation using Power BI.
The simulation is structured around three core tasks:
1.Task 1: Call Centre Trends â€” Analyze customer and agent behaviors by creating a Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and patterns from the provided dataset.
2.Task 2: Customer Retention â€” Use defined KPIs to build a dashboard focused on customer demographics and retention insights.
3.Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion â€” Develop visualizations based on HR data, with an emphasis on gender-related metrics within the executive team
Here are tasks breakdown;

### Visualization 
## Insights into Call Centre Trends

Below information explains the visual above for call center performance reeview 

## 1. Call Answering Performance
Over the three-month period, a total of 4,880 calls were recorded. Out of these:
81.11% (3,960 calls) were successfully answered.
18.89% (920 calls) went unanswered.
This high answering rate indicates efficient call handling at the call centre.
## 2. Issue Resolution Rate
Among the answered calls:
72.94% (3,561 calls) were resolved successfully.
27.06% (1,319 calls) remained unresolved.
Although a majority of calls were resolved, thereâ€™s a significant percentage of unresolved issues that may affect customer satisfaction.
## 3. Customer Satisfaction
The average customer satisfaction score across all agents was 2.76 out of 5.
This is noticeably below the expected benchmark of 4.2, pointing to potential dissatisfaction with the service quality, tone, or resolution effectiveness.
All agents contributed significantly, but variations in response time and satisfaction scores suggest training and quality consistency can be improved.
## 5. Monthly Call Volume Trends
Call volumes were relatively stable each month, with around 1,900 calls received in January, February, and March.
The majority of calls each month were answered, reflecting consistent service delivery.
## 6. Overall Efficiency
The overall average speed of answer was 67.53 seconds, which is moderately acceptable.
There is a clear need to improve satisfaction levels and reduce unresolved cases.
